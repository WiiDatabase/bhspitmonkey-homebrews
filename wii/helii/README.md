# Helii

Helii is a game in which you steer a helicopter through a tunnel. As the game progresses, the tunnel varies in size/shape, and obstacles are introduced.

Coded by BHSPitMonkey, I only fixed the build process and recompiled the DOL so that it supports all official Wiimotes.

## Build

1. Install [devkitPPC](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) and libogc
2. Install [libwiisprite](https://github.com/nebiun/libwiisprite) with `make` and `make install`
3. Clone this repository and navigate to this directory
4. Run `make`
